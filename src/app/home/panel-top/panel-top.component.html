      All WST owners are welcome to join.  Together we can hold the Board accountable and put an end to the secretive, self-serving and corrupt boards that have been a hallmark of the past decade.
      Many of you are sick and tired of the political drama that you have simply given up. You have no interest to be involved or participate within our community.  <br>
      THIS IS THE TIME TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE!<br>
