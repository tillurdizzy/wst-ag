            The ByLaws for WST were written in 1979 by the building contractor, and grant almost dictatorial powers to the President of the HOA. These bylaws were never 
            intended to be permanent, and should have been updated in the early 1980's. 
            As it stands now, there are loop holes and policies that allow for the dishonest and corrupt collection of proxies that keep corrupt boards in power.
            Please see the ByLaws section under Committees for more information.
