      All WST owners are welcome to join.  Together we can hold the Board accountable and put an end to the secretive, self-serving and corrupt boards that have been a hallmark of the past decade.
      Many of you are so sick and tired of the political drama you've simply given up and don't care anymore - don't want to be involved.  But now is the time to make a difference. 
      Two can play at this game.  We plan to use the exact same method of collecting proxies to gain back power, but rather than using that power for self-serving puroposes we will immediately update 
      the Bylaws so that it can never happen again in the future.  Lets fix this problem once and for all. We can do this!<br>
      Click on the 'Members' button above and follow the instructions.

      <div class="paragraph-header">Update Bylaws</div>
      <span>The following three changes to the by-laws will eliminate the corruption and allow for a greatest participation of all our Members in the governing process.</span>
    <div class="paragraph-copy">
      <ul>
        <li>Limit the number of proxies any single owner may hold</li>
        <li>Prevent the Board from removing officers without reason. Currently any three officers may gang up, remove any other board member, 
          and replace them with a loyal "yes men" puppets, without any notification or input from the Members</li>
        <li>Allow secure online voting so members do not need to be present at the annual meeting to vote</li>
    </ul>
