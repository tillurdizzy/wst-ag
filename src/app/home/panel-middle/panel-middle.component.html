        <li>Limit the number of proxies any single owner may hold</li>
        <li>Separate the Board of Directors from the Officers</li>
        <li>Require the President and Vice-President to reside on the property</li>
        <li>Allow secure online voting</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="paragraph-copy">Because our bylaws were written in 1978 (before the internet!), there are many instances where the language is vague, 
      outdated and fails to incorporate modern technology. For a full copy of the bylaws with all the proposed changes highlighted, please become a
