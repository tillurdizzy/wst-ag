      At this time, it is the top priority of WSTAG to update the by-laws so as to prevent the unscrupulous Boards from remaining in power long past the wishes of the Members.
      The current Board is unwilling to make these changes, and must therefore be removed by petition before we can more forward.

    <div class="paragraph-copy">
     Please understand!  The petition alone does not remove the current board members named in the petition, it only calls for a Special Meeting to vote on the issue.  Our by-laws require 1/3 of all Members to sign.
     Once the requirements are met, the board <b >must</b> hold the meeting. Just as in regular annual meetings, a quorum is required and the vote must be at 
     least 51% of the voting members present to pass.

     <div class="paragraph-copy">
      Signing the petition is just the first step.  You must also show up at the meeting and vote.   If you are unable to attend, or just do not wish to, you can sign your vote over to another member by proxie.  Instructions and forms for doing this will be available 
      once the meeting date has been set.  The proxie is only good for this one meeting.
